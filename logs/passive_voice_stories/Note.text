The stories listed here are stories that messed up the annotation. For example the story "#G02# As a Broker user, I want the D1 file generation to be synced with the FPDS data load, so that I don't have to regenerate a file if no data has been updated."
In this story the primary action is "be synced" and the persona is the Broker user, however the relation Broker user -> be synced does not make sense
This is the result of passive voice and the relation D1 file generation-> be synced -> FPDS data load makes sense. 
Such stories are logged in this folder. Although there are other stories in the dataset that are in passive voice, the annotation makes sense.
This folder only contains stories where the annotations could not make it make sense.
