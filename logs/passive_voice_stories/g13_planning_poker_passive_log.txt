#G13# As a participant, I want to be shown all estimates at the same time after all estimators have given their estimate, so that I can be sure estimates are independent and not influenced by other estimates given in the same draw.
#G13# As a developer, I want to have created database indexes, so that the queries run as fast as possible.
#G13# As a Researcher, I want results to be stored in a non-identifiable way, so that I can study the data to see things like whether estimates converged around the first opinion given by "estimator A" for example.
#G13# As a moderator, I want to select an item to be estimated or re-estimated, so that the team sees that item and can estimate it.
